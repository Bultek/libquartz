# libquartz
Quartz protocols and backend that are using qkeys (quartz keys)


## Adding to your project
* import by cloning the repo into your project
* add ```libquartz = {path = "<yourpat"}``` to Cargo.toml (support for other languages isn't tested yet + we didn't add ```no_mangle``` flag to all functions)
* add ```use libquartz::*``` to your rust project's file


## Shortly about keys (qkeys)
* We recommend generating keys using the ```keytools::gen_key();``` function
* Keys MUST be validated using ```keytools::check_if_the_key_is_valid();``` function

## What does each module stand for
* ```keytools``` is used to generate/validate qkeys
* ```msgservices``` is used to communicate between ```quartz-server``` and your project by getting/sending messages
* ```encryption``` is used to encrypt/decrypt data using ```magic_crypt``` and your qkey generated by ```keytools::gen_key();```
