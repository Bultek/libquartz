# libquartz ![LOGO](https://github.com/mrquantumoff/libquartz/raw/master/quartz.png)
Quartz protocols and backend that are using qkeys (quartz keys)


## Adding to your rust project
* import by cloning the repo into your project
* add ```libquartz = {path = "<yourpath>"}``` to Cargo.toml
* add ```use libquartz::*``` to your rust project's file


## Adding to other languages
* We don't actually track support for other languages, but all functions have ```no_mangle``` attribute, so you can compile libquartz to .so/.dll file and add it to your project

## Shortly about keys (qkeys)
* We recommend generating keys using the ```keytools::gen_key();``` function
* Keys MUST be validated using ```keytools::check_if_the_key_is_valid();``` function

## What does each module stand for
* ```keytools``` is used to generate/validate qkeys
* ```msgservices``` is used to communicate between ```quartz-server``` and your project by getting/sending messages
* ```encryption``` is used to encrypt/decrypt data using ```magic_crypt``` and your qkey generated by ```keytools::gen_key();```
